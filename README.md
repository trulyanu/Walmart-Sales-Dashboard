Monthly Sales YOY

The dashboard does not show monthly sales data for previous years, so it is impossible to compare year-over-year sales growth.
Additional Insights

The dashboard shows that sales are concentrated in a few key categories and payment methods. This suggests that the store could focus on promoting other categories and payment methods to increase sales.
The high percentage of COD sales suggests that there may be a demand for more flexible payment options.
The lack of year-over-year sales data makes it difficult to assess the store's overall performance and growth.
Overall, the Walmart store sales dashboard provides  valuable insights into the store's performance.
